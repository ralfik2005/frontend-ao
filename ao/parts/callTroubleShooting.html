<h3>General</h3>
<p>StayPrivate's secure audio and video technology operates within your computer's internet browser. If your internet browser is working properly and it can connect to your microphone, speakers and webcam, then it is unlikely that you will encounter any issues.</p>
<p>It normally takes only a few seconds for your browser to connect to your audio/video devices and to establish a secure connection but, depending on hardware and network performance, it can sometimes take up to 30 seconds.<p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If something goes wrong, in most cases this is for one of the following two reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your internet connection is faulty.</li>
	<li>Your internet browser cannot find or connect to your audio/video devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can test whether your internet connection is faulty by opening a new browser tab and navigating to a different website. Refresh the tab to make sure that your internet connection is live and that you are not seeing a cached version of the site. If the page does not load or takes longer than usual to load, this may indicate that you may have either lost your connection entirely or that your connection is poor.</p><p>If your internet connection seems fine but you are still experiencing issues, then it is most likely that your browser cannot connect to your audio/video devices. There are four reasons why this might happen.</p>

<ul>
	<li>You have accidentally disabled the plug-in or denied the browser access to your audio/video devices.</li> 
	<li>Your internet browser is not working properly.</li>
	<li>A firewall or security application is blocking your browser from accessing your audio/video devices.</li>
	<li>Another program has taken control of your audio/video devices and is not allowing your browser access.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accidentally disabled or denied access</h3>
<p>Fix this by closing the browser completely and restarting and/or by refreshing the broswer tab (use "Ctrl" and "R" for a hard refresh). Exact behaviour varies depending on which version of which browser you are using.</p>

<h3>Faulty browser</h3>
<p>Fix this by either closing the browser completely and restarting and/or by refreshing the browers tab (use "Ctrl" and "R" for a hard refresh).</p>

<h3>Security application blocking</h3>
<p>Check the log file of your firewall or internet security application to discover what is blocking the browser from activating the audio/video stream. Change the settings to allow real-time audio/video communciation through the .secure-comm.com domain.</p>

<h3>Other software</h3>
<p>With proper behavior, other audio/video software should not prevent your browser from accessing your audio/video devices. Unfortunately this is not always the case. You may be able to fix problematic behavior by closing the culprit program, but sometimes the problem can only be resolved by restarting your computer.</p>
