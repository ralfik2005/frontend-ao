The way information information stored wihin the system is shared by a company is entirely a matter for that company.</p>

<a name="UsingAO"><h2>Using VideoMeetingsNOW</h2></a>
<p>You can access VideoMeetingsNOW through most modern web browsers or using the Secure Portal app on your iOS or Android mobile device or tablet. The interface is necessarily arranged slightly differently depending on the device and screen resolution, and certain features (including parts of Account Management) are not available on mobile devices or tablets, but your experience of the system should be similar across all devices.</p>

<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>When you log in, the first page you see is your "Dashboard". This contains a summary of all recent activity from all your contacts, with the most recent at the top. You can click on each item to see the underlying content. When you click on an item you are taken to the contact with which that activity is associated. The active contact is displayed in the top left corner of your screen. Once a contact is active you can start communicating with that contact.</p>

<h3>Make Call</h3>
<p>To join or begin a conference video call, click on "Make Call". Depending on your settings, you can choose whether to record the call or not. (VideoMeetingsNOW only records audio, not video.)</p>
<p>At the bottom right of your screen you will see settings enabling you to turn off and on your video, mute and unmute your mic or pause (temporarily turn off your mic and video).</p>

<h3>Screen Sharing</h3>
<p>If another participant in a meeting is sharing a screen you will see a small version of their screen super-imposed over the top left of their video. Click on this image and their shared screen will swap places with their video feed, allowing you to see their screen more clearly, and making their video feed smaller.</p>

<h3>Share Screen</h3>
<p>During a call you can share a window from your computer screen by clicking on "Share Screen". This will bring up a list of available windows to share. Click on the one you wish to share to start sharing this window live. The shared window will remain active on the other participants' screens until the end of the call or until cancelled.</p>

<h3>Screen Sharing in Chrome</h3>
<p>Later versions of the Chrome browser by default do not allow plug-ins. VideoMeetingsNOW does not need a plug-in to work in Chrome, with one exception: if you wish to share your screen, you must use the VideoMeetingsNOW plug-in (you can still see other users' screens without the plug-in). To enable the plug-in, please follow the following steps. Firstly, enable NPAPI by going to the following URL: chrome://flags/#enable-npapi in your Chrome browser, and under "Enable NPAPI" select "Enable". Secondly, restart Chrome. Thirdly, log back into VideoMeetingsNOW. Fourthly, within the video set up process (which should start automatically once you log back into VideoMeetingsNOW) choose "Advanced Options" and deselect the final option to allow screen sharing in Chrome.</p>
