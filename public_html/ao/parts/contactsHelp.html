		<p>Importing your existing contact lists is the safest and easiest way to add contacts in Quorum. Imported lists are added to your own private list, which is accessible to you only. To create Quorum contacts or groups from your private contact list, select "NEW", and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
		<p>This two-step process has been designed to enable you to confidently upload existing contact lists without needing to check them or worrying about contacting people accidentally. Once you have uploaded your lists, you can then easily search and select the contacts with whom you wish to communicate.</p>
		<p>Exporting your contact lists is usually a simple process. Click on the examples below to see how to export from the following environments:</p>
