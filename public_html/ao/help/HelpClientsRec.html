<a name="UsingAO"><h2>Using RecordMeetingsNOW</h2></a>
<p>You can access RecordMeetingsNOW through most modern web browsers or using the Secure Portal app on your iOS or Android mobile device or tablet. The interface is necessarily arranged slightly differently depending on the device and screen resolution, and certain features (including parts of Account Management) are not available on mobile devices or tablets, but your experience of the system should be similar across all devices.</p>

<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>When you log in, the first page you see is your "Dashboard". This contains a summary of all recent activity from all your contacts, with the most recent at the top. You can click on each item to see the underlying content. When you click on an item you are taken to the contact with which that activity is associated. The active contact is displayed in the top left corner of your screen. Once a contact is active you can start communicating with that contact.</p>
