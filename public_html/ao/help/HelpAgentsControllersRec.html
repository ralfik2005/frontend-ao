<a name="Overview"><h2>A Brief Overview of RecordMeetingsNOW</h2></a>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>RecordMeetingsNOW is a cloud-based service that provides a secure, white-labelled environment for business communication, both within your organization and externally with clients, associates and other contacts. The RecordMeetingsNOW platform is configurable and has been designed to reflect "real world" business practices. It works with existing systems, including email and calendars.</p>
<p>RecordMeetingsNOW provides a private and professional network for audio recording and file storage. All communication is stored securely.</p>
<p>RecordMeetingsNOW can be accessed from any internet-enabled computer, tablet or mobile phone, via internet browser, app or telephone.</p>

<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>RecordMeetingsNOW enables you to ensure that all your information is at all times correctly organized and is shared between only those with whom it should be shared. To ensure that information is always shared safely, RecordMeetingsNOW uses the concept of private groups, or groups for short. All communications are associated with a group. Each group is defined by its members. There can be one, two or more members of a group. Each member of the group sees all communications within the group. Users (unless they are Controllers, who have special rights as described below) can only access groups of which they are a member.</p>

<h3>User Types</h3>
<p>There are five types of user supported by the System:</p>
<ul margin-left: 10px>
<li>System Administrator</li>
<li>Administrator</li>
<li>Agent (normally known as Colleague)</li>
<li>Client</li>
<li>Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>Each system has a unique System Administrator. There is no limit on the number of other users. RecordMeetingsNOW is designed to scale efficiently to any size.</p>
<p>You can arrange the System however you wish, in order to suit your needs best, however the names of the five user types are designed to represent a "typical" company set up. Of course, no company is ever entirely typical, so please do not feel constrained by the names of the user types.</p>
<p>In the typical company, most employees are Agents. Agents can set up new Agents and new groups, but cannot edit or delete users and groups. Administrators (including the System Administrator) have extra rights, enabling them to set up, amend and delete users and groups. Companies normally set up their customers as Clients. Client users cannot set up any new users or groups.</p>
<p>Controllers have extra rights granting them either read only or full access to other, specified user accounts. Controllers can be used in a variety of ways, for example, to supervise junior employees, to provide cover while other users are away on holiday, or to enable compliance oversight. Because of their powerful extra rights, it is important to take extra care with Controller users.</p>
<br>
<a name="AccessRights"><h2>Access Rights</h2></a>
<p>All users of the system have the right to start, participate and see the full history of communication within all the groups of which they are a member. Any member of a group can move, edit and amend files stored in that group.</p>

<h3>System Administrator</h3>
<p>The System Administrator has control over the entire system, including the right to set up new users of any type, edit and delete users, add new groups, edit and delete groups, change system settings, change branding and change color scheme. The System Administrator can "see" all users and groups in the system.</p>

<h3>Administrator</h3>
<p>Administrators can set up new users of any type, edit and delete users, add new groups and edit and delete groups. Unlike the System Administrator, the Administrator can only see users and groups that the Administrator has set up. This allows the system to be segmented into separate divisions, with different Administrators taking responsibility for different divisions of the overall.</p>

<h3>Agent</h3>
<p>Agents are (typically, depending on system settings) able to set up new users and add new Groups. Agents cannot delete users or groups.</p>

<h3>Controller</h3>
<p>Controllers have the extra power to be able to access, either on a read-only or read-write basis (depending on system settings), the accounts of users who have a one-to-one group with the Controller. Typically, large companies operate separate Controller accounts separately alongside their normal user accounts, rather than making certain users Controllers. This enables, for example, compliance departments to use their normal (and more restricted) user accounts for their own communications, whilst still having available the Controller functionality they require to fulfil their role. It also allows companies to put extra controls around the use of Controller accounts, which is something we recommend.</p>

<h3>Client</h3>
<p>Clients have no rights to add or edit users or groups. Depending on system settings, they are able to edit their own details, such as email and telephone number.</p>

<br>
<a name="Email"><h2>Email</h2></a>

<p>Once a user has entered their email address under their account details, emails sent to them via RecordMeetingsNOW will automatically forward on to their existing email account. The emails will originate from the Always Organised Secure Communications Portal, at www.secure-comm.com, and carry the name of the company, the sender and the associated group (if there is one). Users can reply to these emails using their existing email account and the reply will both appear in the RecordMeetingsNOW system and also forward through to the existing email accounts of the other member of the same group (provided they have an email address stored in the system).</p>

<br>
<a name="URLs"><h2>URLs</h2></a>

<p>Your system can be accessed at yourcompanyID.secure-comm.com. You will need a username and password to be able to log in. You will also find that you can access your system via the "Login" option at the main www.RecordMeetingsNOW.com website, but in this case you will also need to enter yourcompanyID (which is your unique company ID) along with your username and password (since this website is not specific to your company).</p>
<p>Users of the Secure Portal app will also need to enter yourcompanyID the first time they log in. We can provide an own branded version of the app but this is an enterprise feature.</p>

<br>
<a name="Security"><h2>Security</h2></a>

<p>RecordMeetingsNOW employs market-leading security technology throughout, including: transport layer security, AES-256 bit encryption (both for data transfer and for files held in storage), EU-located servers, Tier 4 data centers, strict corporate governance, access controls, policies and procedures.</p>
<p>RecordMeetingsNOW can be configured to send out an email to the user's account every time the user logs onto the system. This means that users are immediately notified if an outside party has gained access to their account. RecordMeetingsNOW is also configured to lock users out of accounts after four failed password attempts. If you require further access controls, you can upgrade your system with PIN authentication.</p>

<a name="SystemSetUp"><h2>System Set Up</h2></a>

<h3>Branding</h3>
<p>The System Administrator can upload logos and change the color scheme to match your brand. You do this by clicking on "Theme" (on the bottom right of the main screen). You will presented with a series of options, including "Styles", where you can set all the various colors used by the System, and "Logos", where you can upload your own logos (the system requires a "Main Logo", a "Small Logo" and a "Thumbnail Logo").</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>There are various settings that are available at a system level. Depending on your system settings, the System Administrator can change company-wide settings by clicking on "Theme" (on the bottom right of the main screen) and choosing "Settings".</p>

<a name="UserSetUp"><h2>User Set Up</h2></a>

<h3>New Users</h3>
<p>You can set up new users either by clicking on "New" and following the simple instructions, or by clicking on "Account" (on the right hand side of the main screen), and selecting "User". Note that only administrators have sufficient rights to see this option. Clicking on "Create New User" opens a box in which you can add all the details for a new user. The types of user that may be created also depend on that user's rights.</p>

<h3>Editing Users</h3>
<p>Administrators can edit a user by clicking on "Account" (on the right hand side of the main screen), and selecting "User". You then edit a specific user by clicking on the pen graphic next to the user you want to edit. You can also delete users by clicking on the "X".</p>

<br>
<a name="groupSetUp"><h2>Group Set up</h2></a>

<h3>New Groups</h3>
<p>The simplest way to set up new groups is to click on "New" and follow the onscreen instructions. However, administrators have two further ways to set up a new group: either directly, or via a user:</p>
<ol>
<li>To set up a new group directly, click on "Account" (on the right hand side of the main screen) and select "groups". Clicking on "Create New Group" opens a box allowing you to create a new group. You can choose the users you wish to become members of the group from the directory displayed (note that the directory only displays certain users, depending on your access rights). Select the users you wish to be in the new group by clicking on the icon directly to the left of each user's name. You can type in the group name (which is only necessary for groups with more than two members) in the "Name" field at the top. To save the new group click "Save Changes".<br></li>
<li>You can also set up a new group by going to a particular user who you wish to be part of a new group. This can be useful because it enables you to easily see what groups are already set up for that user. Click on "Account" (on the right hand side of the main screen) and select "User". Then click on the pen graphic next to the user you want to include in the new group. Select "User groups" then when you click on "Update User and Create New group" the same box as described in 1 above will pop up, with the first member of the group already populated. Then proceed as above.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Editing Groups</h3>
<p>There are two ways to edit an existing group, either directly, or via a user:</p>
<ol>
<li>To edit a group directly, click on "Account" (on the right hand side of the main screen) and select "Group". Note that some users (e.g. clients) do not have sufficient rights to see this option. You will see a list of groups (note that only certain groups are displayed, depending on your user rights). You edit a group by clicking the pen icon at next to the group you wish to edit.<br></li>
<li>You can also remove a particular user from a group by going via that particular user. Click on "Account" (on the right hand side of the main screen) and select "User". Then click on the pen graphic next to the user you want to remove from a group. Select "User Groups"; you will see a list of the groups of which that user is a member. You can remove a user from any or all of the groups displayed. Note that, before any changes to become active, you must click on one of the "Update User" buttons.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<a name="UsingAO"><h2>Using RecordMeetingsNOW</h2></a>
<p>You can access RecordMeetingsNOW through most modern web browsers or using the Secure Portal app on your iOS or Android mobile device or tablet. The interface is necessarily arranged slightly differently depending on the device and screen resolution, and certain features (including parts of Account Management) are not available on mobile devices or tablets, but your experience of the system should be similar across all devices.</p>

<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>When you log in, the first page you see is your "Dashboard". This contains a summary of all recent activity in all your groups, with the most recent at the top. You can click on each item to see the underlying content. When you click on an item you are taken to the group from which that activity is associated. The active group is displayed in the top left corner of your screen. Once a group is active you can start communicating with that group.</p>
<p>Next to the "Recent" tab, you will see "Groups", "Colleagues" and "Clients". You can click on each these tabs to see a list of your groups of each type. If you then click on the group, it will become active and the system will display all recent activity from that group in the centre part of the screen.</p>

<p>My Area is your private space on the system. It is for information that is just yours and you do not want to share with anyone else. As well as using this to keep your own private records and files, certain system messages are logged in this area. My Area is not available to Client users.</p>

<h3>Client Users</h3>
<p>Clients see a slightly different screen when they first log in. Rather than having the separate options for Groups, Colleagues and Clients, they have only one option, "Contacts". There is no "My Office" for Client users.</p>

<h3>Vault</h3>
<p>The vault is the active group's secure, private storage area. Members of a group can view and download files stored here. Depending on your access rights, you can upload new files, create new folders, move and delete files. Note that in the case of My Area, the vault is your own private storage area.</p>
<p>To add a new file to the Vault, go into the Vault, click on the "Add" button at the bottom of the screen, and choose "Upload File". To create a new folder, click on the "Add" button and choose "Create Folder".</p>

<h3>Make Recording</h3>
<p>Click on "Make Recording" to record a voice message to share with other members of the group.</p>

<h3>New</h3>
<p>Here you can set up new users and groups. Simply follow the onscreen instructions.</p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>You can use Schedule to email a meeting request or a reminder. The request or reminder will be sent within the system and forwarded to the email inboxes of the group members in a format that enables them to save it directly into their existing calendar.</p>

<h3>Account</h3>
<p>Here you can change your password, your email address and other personal details. If you have the necessary rights, you can add or edit users and groups too.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>You can add private notes to any message or conversation. Simply click on the "Notes" dropdown in the centre top of your screen. Notes are private to you only and are not shared with other members of the group.</p>
