<a name="Overview"><h3>A Brief Overview of SyncedUp</h3></a>

<p>SyncedUp is the secure personal communication service from StayPrivate. SyncedUp provides you with a safe place online where you can share private and confidential information, keep your communications safe and secure, and ensure that your information remains yours and yours only.</p>
<p>With SyncedUp you can send and recieve secure emails, files and instant messages. All your information is secured using military-grade technology, fully proteced data centres and strict security protocols. Each user has their own unique encryption key, generated from their username, password and PIN, so that every conversation remains private, confidential and secure.</p>
<p>You can access SyncedUp through any modern web browser or via the SyncedUp app on your iOS or Android device.</p>

<h3>Private Sharing</h3>
<p>All communications are private between the sender and the recipient or recipients. Communications are grouped into private channels according to the users involved. A channel can be a "one-to-one" (between two users), a "group" (between three or more users) or "solo" (private to an individual user).</p>

<a name="Email"><h3>Emails</h3></a>

<p>Notifications of secure emails sent via SyncedUp are automatically sent to the user's email account. These emails originate from your SyncedUp account. Users can read reply securely by clicking on the smartlink and accessing the email in SyncedUp.</p>


<a name="Security"><h3>Security</h3></a>

<p>SyncedUp employs military grade security technology throughout, including: transport layer security, AES-256 encryption (both for data transfer and for files held in storage), EU-located servers, fully protected data centers and strict corporate governance, access controls, policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Users need to enter a user name, email and PIN to log into SyncedUp. They are locked out of accounts after four failed password or PIN attempts. And are challenged for further identification when accessing from an unrecognsied device. For even more security, SyncedUp can be configured to send an email every time a user logs onto the system, so that users are immediately notified if a third party gains access to their account.</p>
