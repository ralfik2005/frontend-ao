<a name="Overview"><h3>This Secure Web Portal</h3></a>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This secure web portal provides you with a safe place where you can communicate securely with your contacts. Use it to send emails, share files, send instant messages, and to see a full audit trail of all activity.</p>

<h3>Private Channels</h3>
<p>All communications are carried by secure private channels. Channels can be a 'one-to-one' (between two users), a 'group' (between three or more users) or, in the case of 'My Area', private to an individual user.</p>

<a name="Email"><h3>Email</h3></a>

<p>Notifications of secure emails are sent to contacts' email accounts. They can reply securely using either their normal email account (in the case of company users) or by clicking on the smart link and using the Secure Portal (in the case of clients).</p>
<p>Company users can choose whether to encrypt the entire email message (the default) or to only encrypt attachments. The content of an encrypted email and/or attachment can only be accessed by a client from within the Secure Portal, ensuring that information remains secure at all times.</p>

<h3>Vault</h3>

<p>Use the vault to share and organise files securely with contacts. Simply double click on a file to see a preview, including a full history of all activity related to that file. Contacts are notified every 24 hours of activity in the vault; if you require your contacts to be alerted sooner, simply send them a secure email.</p>

<h3>Chat</h3>

<p>You can use chat to sent secure instant messages to your contacts. If they are not logged in, they will receive an email alert, prompting them to log in to view the instant message.</p>

<a name="Access"><h3>Portal Access</h3></a>

<p>Access the Secure Web Portal is by clicking on the smart link in an email and entering your PIN, or from a browser at yourcompanyID.secure-comm.com and use your username and password to log in.</p>
<p>You can also access your secure environment from a mobile device (tablet or phone) using the Secure Portal app from StayPrivate, available for download free from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/secure-portal/id1005595620?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alwaysorg.ao" target="_blank">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/dl/android?asin=B0120H3U20" target="_blank">Amazon</a> app stores.</p>
<p>Users can request an immediate password reset, but there is 24-hour quarantine period before a PIN is reset. Users are locked out after four failed password or PIN attempts.</p>

<a name="Security"><h3>Security</h3></a>

<p>This secure environment is provided by <a href="https://www.stayprivate.com" target="_blank">StayPrivate</a> and employs market-leading security technology and practices throughout, including AES-256 encryption (for both data transfer and files held in storage), EU-located servers, fully protected data centres and strict corporate governance, access controls, policies and procedures.</p>


<h3>User Types</h3>
There are five user types:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:25px list-style-type: disc;">
<li>System Administrator</li>
<li>Administrator</li>
<li>Agent</li>
<li>Client</li>
<li>Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>All user types can communicate with all other user types, either directly or as part of groups. The differences between user types lie in their different rights. For example, Agents can add new Clients and private channels, but they cannot edit or delete users and channels; client users cannot set up any new users or channels.</p>

<h3>System Administrator</h3>
<p>The System Administrator has control over the entire company system, and has rights to set up new users of any type, edit and delete users and channels, plus to change system settings, branding and theming.</p>

<h3>Administrator</h3>
<p>Administrators can set up new users of any type (other than a System Administrator), edit and delete users, add new channels, and edit and delete channels. Unlike System Administrators, an Administrator can only see users and channels that are associated with that Administrator. This allows a system to be segmented into separate areas, with different Administrators taking responsibility for different sections. Every user other than the System Administrator is associated with an Administrator, with Administrators thereby forming a strict hierarchy with the System Administrator at the top.</p>

<h3>Agent</h3>
<p>Agents are able to set up new Clients and Agents and add new channels but they cannot delete users or channels. In a typical company, the majority of employees are Agents, and this is the default user type for new company users.</p>

<h3>Controller</h3>
<p>Controllers have all the same rights as Agents but with the significant extra power that they can access (on a read-only basis) the accounts of any other user with whom they have a one-to-one channel.</p>

<h3>Client</h3>
<p>Clients cannot add, edit or delete users or channels. They may edit their own details, such as their email address and telephone number.</p>

<a name="DelegatedAccess"><h3>Delegated Access</h3></a>
<p>Agents can delegate access to their account to one or more other users. This enables other users to operate on behalf of the Agent, and is useful for enabling Personal Assistants, or to provide continuity during periods of holiday.</p>
